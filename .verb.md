**Heads up!**

This lib was completely refactored in `v0.2.0`. Please see the [API documentation](#API) for more details.

**About**

This library provides the necessary methods for creating your own GitHub API library or more specific functionality built on top of these methods.

- [.request](#request): the base handler all of the GitHub API VERBS: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`
- [.get](#get): proxy for `request('GET', path, data, cb)`
- [.paged](#paged): makes repeat `.get()` requests until the page of data has been retrieved.
- [.del](#del): proxy for `request('DEL', path, data, cb)`
- [.patch](#patch): proxy for `request('PATCH', path, data, cb)`
- [.post](#post): proxy for `request('POST', path, data, cb)`
- [.put](#put): proxy for `request('PUT', path, data, cb)`

## Usage

```js
var GitHub = require('{%= name %}');
var github = new GitHub({
  username: YOUR_USERNAME,
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD,
});

// or 
var github = new GitHub({
  token: YOUR_TOKEN
});

// or 
var github = new GitHub({
  bearer: YOUR_JWT
});
```

## Why another "GitHub API" lib?

Every other GitHub API library I found either had a [huge dependency tree](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gh-got), tries to be [everything to everyone](https://github.com/michael/github/blob/master/package.json#L45-L56), was [too bloated with boilerplace code](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github/tree/master/templates), was too opinionated or not maintained.
